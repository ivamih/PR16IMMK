## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

We have chosen a competition from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic#description.

In this challenge, we are asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we will apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

**Practice Skills**
- Binary classification
- Python and R basics

**Goal** - to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. For each PassengerId in the test set, we will predict a 0 or 1 value for the Survived variable.

**Metric** - percentage of passengers correctly predicted.

**Data** <br />
The data that we will be using has been split into two groups:
- training set (train.csv)
- test set (test.csv)
